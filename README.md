Zapshark Technologies (Richard Seese) contribution to knowledge with a wide assortment of PHP5.6 syntax with excessive documentation. GNU GPL v2. Fork and learn! 

I am willing to open up commits to those who do not mind adding their names to @author and throwing in a shameless @link plug to wherever they want. Contact Richard Seese at contactus@zapshark.com to learn more. No gimmicks, just have a willingness to share your knowledge with the world! Nam et ipsa scientia potestas est ad infinitum. 

Badges can be posted along with Richard's under your name if you are a part of the Open Source Team or above. Knowledge is power, but money pays the bills. The Open Source Initiative of Zapshark Technologies is our way of contributing to knowledge through code. If you are a non-profit or a part of an open source team, contact Zapshark Technologies directly at the contactus email for free services, and yes, mentoring on a first come first serve basis! Only so much of us to go around!
